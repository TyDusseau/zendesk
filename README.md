# IT Support Automation Lab - Zendesk

## Overview

I set up a home lab in Zendesk to simulate a real helpdesk environment. I created different groups for IT and HR, added sample end-users, and assigned tickets with varying priorities. I built SLA policies to measure first reply and resolution times, then tested how tickets changed when priorities were updated. I also configured triggers to escalate tickets when SLAs were breached. This lab let me practice how a helpdesk agent manages requests, applies macros, and works within real-world support workflows.

## Skills Learned

- Configured SLA policies to track first reply and resolution times for different ticket priorities

- Built triggers and automations to escalate tickets and notify managers upon SLA breaches

- Applied macros and priority settings to simulate real-world helpdesk workflows

- Managed ticket routing and escalation across multiple support tiers

### Tools Used

- Zendesk SLA Policies – tracked response and resolution times

- Triggers – automated escalations and notifications

- Macros – applied pre-defined responses for common issues

- Views & Groups – organized tickets and managed support tiers

- Reporting – monitored ticket trends and SLA compliance
